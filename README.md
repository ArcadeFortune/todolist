# Todolist
A list to manage your personal tasks, who would've thought.

### How to use
Open my [website](https://todo-frontend-arcadefortune-dev.apps.sandbox-m3.1530.p1.openshiftapps.com) and start right away! <br/>

### Features
You can add, edit, and remove tasks.

### The point
I am well aware of the infinite amount of other, better todolists, my goal is to create an application which uses a frontend, backend and a database all at once.

```
2. Change directory
