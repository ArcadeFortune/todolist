# Todolist
A list to manage your personal tasks, who would've thought.

### How to use
Open my website on [not implemented yet](https://example.com) and start right away! <br/>
When my free 30-days trial on openshift ends, try my [vercel link](https://example.com) instead

### Features
You can add, edit, and remove tasks.

### The point
I am well aware of the infinite amount of other, better todolists, my goal is to create an application which uses a frontend, backend and a database all at once.

### How to run it on your own
1. Get the code
```
git clone https://github.com/arcadefortune/todolist
```
2. Change Directory
```
cd todolist
```
3. Run the code
```

```
4. Happy Hacking!
